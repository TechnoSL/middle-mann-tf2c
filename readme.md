# middle mann but on tf2c

aka: the unofficial lionhud continuation with some fancier materials

yeah that's about it, refer to [gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/467611) for screenshots

this should work as of latest TF2C update (2.1.5) and probably way into the future

this entire port uses Jofre Problem's LionHud TF2C port as base: <https://gamebanana.com/mods/381454>
